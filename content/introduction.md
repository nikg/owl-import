#### **Scenario**

Scenario is a simplified and fascinating way to navigate user through the application. They represent an interactive demo environment allowing both non-technical (business) and technical (architects, DevOps) audiences to experience a simulation of app's capabilities.

Each simulation is bound to a specific demo scenario, provides a pre-defined set of steps to follow, and cannot provide additional options of features. The user follows steps and gets familiar with the environment and features.

Scenario represents a set of steps (in the form of files) put together. It tells a story actively involving users and inviting to interact. Scenarios can be personalized if needed, and the required input data can also be customizable.
