### Dashboard

Dashboard provides detailed analytics across the whole workspace.

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** in the left-side workspace menu.

2. Dashboard page will open. First, you can specify time period to get analytics for. Next, you can scroll down to see a bunch of useful information, e.g. total hits, total unique sessions, total time spent in the workspace, most popular scenarios by hits, unique sessions or time, and a lot more.

### Analytics

1. **Analytics dashboard for an object**

Scenario, module and project have their own analytics. In order to see the full analytics dashboard for an object, select **Analytics** in its service menu. This will open analytics dashboard for the object.

2. **Simplified analytics within 30 days for an object**

We can also see fast and simplified analytics for a period of 30 days over object cards where:

2.1 Total number of scenario hits. For project and module the system collects total number of hits for all the scenarios inside them.

2.2 Positive/negative dynamics compared to the previous period of 30 days:

2.3 Daily number of hits within a month where the red dotted line shows daily average value:

2.4 Data collected after deployment is highlighted in a light pink color (available only if this object was deployed within the last 30 days):

2.5 If an object is less than 60 days, this symbol will appear meaning there's not enough data to show the dynamics:

**Note**: scenarios in the [Scenarios](/portal/scenarios) section show common statistics for all deploys of this scenario, whereas the same scenario inside a module and project shows statistics for this version only.
