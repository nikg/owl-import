### User Journey

User Journey outlines session ID, country, IP address, date and events count. Within each session it displays scenario name, steps, screens, duration and timing.

You can see user journey for [deployed](/portal/deploy) objects across the whole workspace by navigating to **User Journey** in the left-side workspace menu.

This will open user journey page. It displays data by sessions. You can specify time period to get information for.

Note that user journey of a scenario viewed via the **Scenarios** section shows general statistics for all deploys of this scenario, whereas scenario user journey viewed via a module displays statistics for a current deploy of this scenario.
