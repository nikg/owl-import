### Workspace Structure

Workspace is user's space for work with [scenarios](/portal/scenarios), [modules](/portal/modules) and [projects](/portal/projects) which are workspace key objects. User can either

- create a workspace themself and be its [admin](/portal/access#operational-level-roles) by default, or

- be invited to a workspace object with an assigned [access-level role](/portal/access#access-level-roles).

Note that only workspace [admin](/portal/access#operational-level-roles) has access to workspace settings.

### Create Workspace

There are two ways to create a workspace:

1. If it is your first logging into the https://portal.upmix.it/, you will see the creation form right after signing up:

2. If you are logged in, you can create a workspace from workspace menu:

<figure><img src="/assets/workspace_create.png" width="60%" height="30%"/></figure>

Note that workspace name cannot be changed and it should be a unique one.

### Preview Theme

Preview theme for a separate scenario is defined by Workspace **Theme for Preview**. Note that if a scenario is added to a project, its preview theme within the project is defined in [project settings](/portal/projects#project-theme). Select workspace preview theme as follows:

**Default Theme**

Default theme is specified by default. It provides preview settings, navigation means, opening editing mode, sharing a link to a page, and opening scenario content menu. More details on preview themes can be found [here](/portal/preview#scenario-preview-details).

**Minimalist Theme**

Minimalist theme provides simplified UI. It allows enabling full-screen mode, resetting values and restarting the experience, disabling highlights for controls and their hints, switching between dark and light themes, and opening editing mode. More details on preview themes can be found [here](/portal/preview#scenario-preview-details).

### Workspace Access

Only workspace [admin](/portal/access#operational-level-roles) has access to workspace settings, including Access. Detailed information on role types, their rights and ways of assigning the roles can be found [here](/portal/access).

Types of user roles in Portal:

- [Access-level roles](/portal/access#access-level-roles): reader, contributor, editor, owner. They are assigned for an object only (scenario, module, project) and define types of rights for this object.

- [Operational-level roles](/portal/access#operational-level-roles): admin, approver. They are assigned across the whole workspace and define rights to perform various operations.
