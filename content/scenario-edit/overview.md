### Overview

Overview mode collects all texts and descriptions in one place making it convenient for a user to edit or enter them. After adding or editing text, the text is saved and updated in corresponding steps automatically.

### Last Update

Overview displays the date of the last text update next to each step and screen. Make sure to open Overview in a new browser tab to see newly added updates.

### Screen Notes

Every screen can have notes that are not seen in [preview](/portal/preview#scenario-preview) but come in handy when we want to add voiceover or notes to screens. Enable displaying notes as follows:

### Fold / Unfold Text

The folding / unfolding buttons let us open / close all the steps and screens at a time. It is especially convenient when you want to run through the whole scenario wording.

### Filters

- **Show merged screens** displays all the screens including the [merged](/scenario-edit/structure#merged-screens) ones

- **Show with forced description** displays only [merged](/scenario-edit/structure#merged-screens) screens that have their own descriptions different from the main one.
